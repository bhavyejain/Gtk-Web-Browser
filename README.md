# GTK WEB BROWSER

This repository contains 3 browser implementations.
The web browsers are created using the GTK+3 GUI toolkit and WebKit2 web engine.

## Browser
```browser.py``` is a single tab browser made by following some online tutorials.
It uses outdated versions of the WebKit engine. This version of WebKit works for Ubuntu 16.04 and older.
An installation of the older version of WebKit might be required to make this work.
